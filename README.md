# Learning Docker and Docker Compose, Putting my Experimental Stuff here
   
## I am learning Docker from scratch which includes the below:

1. Master the Docker CLI.
2. Build my own custom images for small applications.
3. Inspect and debug the running containers.
4. Push the custom images to private repository on Docker Hub.
5. Build a CI/CD pipeline from scratch with Github and Travis CI.
6. Integration of Github and Travis CI.
7. Automatically deploy the code via Travis CI when it is pushed to Github.
8. Work on multiple images with Docker compose.
